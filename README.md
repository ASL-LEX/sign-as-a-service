# Sign as a Service

## Introduction
Sign language lacks the digital representation like written languages like English. Sign as a Service serves to provide a solution to this by allowing uploads of lexicons, short videos of people signing, where the users can search using how to sign specific words. Lexicons of it and associated words will pop up. This allows for the seamless learning of American Sign Language. 

Sign as a Service offers an admin view of the MUI Data Grid Table that allows admins to perform CRUD operations of Lexicons.
